I design my Tokenizer.cpp by C++ and I read the word by string first.
If the string is the same as token, I add token into my Tokenizer object.
My hard part is that I read file by string, so it's difficult for me to separate "ABC;".
Luckily, I came up with the idea to separate them.
I use Linkedlist to store my token because we do not the exact length of program.
My Linkedlist name is LinkedList and my Tokenizer object is "mytokenizer".
